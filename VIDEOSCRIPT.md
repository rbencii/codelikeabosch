    Name:

    Motto - Powerful message:

    Assurance that we had the end users and community as our first priority:

    Explanation of the UI design choices, 
        *shown on screen :
            Edit and change some cars control panel to our program and stuff:
        Emphasise that the extra information we provide is:
            Easy to understand
            Easy to notice
            Accurate
        Alert System:
            We did the task of differentiating between pedestrians, cyclist etc, so we treat them differently
            Clear instructions
            Based on other products commercial succes, such as cheap chinese dashcam and volkswagen drive assistance, we made the attention you are too close to the person infront
            starting out from this idea, we thought outside the box, so if someone else tailgates you and is really close in the rear of yo car, you get some notification so u can make safe decisons and avoid sudden braking or dangerous manouvers, it is also helpful if u are overtaking someone and the person behind you also tries to do the same. 
        Precise simulation:
            perfectly scaled
            realtime representative
            indicated blindspots,radar and camera positions.
        Currently for the hackathons purpose:
            Menu for testing
            Data is also listed on the screen in text

    Code-Tech:
        Python:
            arcade
        Starting point:
            We tried to understand the task and the proposed task, so we discused every provided information
            we came to the conclusion that in reality the program we want wont have every data at the same time, so we handle the data with the time field and syncronize the simulation based on that.
        Paradigm:
            For better project scaling aspects we used the object oriented paradigm, so it is easy to add new features
        

    Future prospects:
        For the hackathon our focus was to do something complete and although We tried to optimalize our code in the limited time we had it was not top priority now, so there is room for improvement, it is recommended that the calculation heavy parts are done in c++ and the python part is just for the UI and the data handling.
        Innovative idea to also present
        We think that based on the data the camera and radar detects, it could be good to collect this data anonymusly and process it with machine learning in a way that we would have statistics about the most dangerous situations and the most common moving patterns. With such proccesed data object movement prediction and danger avoidance could do a leap.

*Read out loud on a smoothing voice:
    Vehicle Radar Help System
    *-dramatic pause of 4s
    Keep everyone safe on the road

    We designed our software based on this principle.
    We implemented an alert system, that helps the driver notice possible dangerous situations
    before they happen.
    
    Although the userinterface might seem crude for the first sight, but it was delibertly designed to be fitted on a cars center panel. Alerts and important information is always clearly readable and it is easy to understand the situation around the car, from just a glance.

    As we vowed to provide a system that accuratly analises the situation, we implented precise simulation that scales every detail to the screen in perfect ratio.
